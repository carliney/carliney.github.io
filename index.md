## Research Interests

- Computer vision
- Underwater robotics
- Object recognition
- Deep learning
- Image processing

During my master's program, my research focus is on computer vision applied to underwater robotics. I conducted research on the application of underwater robotics in coral detection. I designed and manufactured a specialized underwater robot for coral detection, and developed an algorithm for coral identification, counting, and size measurement. This algorithm was integrated into the underwater robot to achieve real-time coral detection. Apart from the robot manufacturing, I independently completed all aspects of the project, including algorithm integration and debugging, as well as conducting experiments in both water tanks and the open sea. The findings of this project have been published in a research paper.
