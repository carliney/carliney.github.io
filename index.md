## Research Interests

- Computer vision
- Image processing
- Hydrothermal vent
- coral reef

My doctoral research focuses on hydrothermal systems. I aim to obtain flow velocities of different types of hydrothermal vent emissions based on hydrothermal observations. I conduct three-dimensional reconstructions of hydrothermal areas using acoustic, laser, or image methods. We utilize Raman spectroscopy equipment to measure the chemical concentrations of hydrothermal fluids to determine hydrothermal flux. Recently, I have been experimenting with simulating hydrothermal vents using OpenFOAM. I specialize in handling various image-related information.


During my master's program, my research focus is on computer vision applied to underwater robotics. I conducted research on the application of underwater robotics in coral detection. I designed and manufactured a specialized underwater robot for coral detection, and developed an algorithm for coral identification, counting, and size measurement. This algorithm was integrated into the underwater robot to achieve real-time coral detection. Apart from the robot manufacturing, I independently completed all aspects of the project, including algorithm integration and debugging, as well as conducting experiments in both water tanks and the open sea. The findings of this project have been published in a research paper.

Light and images have infinite potential. They encompass rich visual elements and can perform a variety of tasks such as object identification, tracking, speed measurement, counting, segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and more. Let us unleash the boundless potential of human-image interaction.
